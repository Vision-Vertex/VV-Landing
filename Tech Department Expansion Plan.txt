Tech Department Expansion Plan 

 

As the Power Platform department nears successful completion of its training phase with trainees already shadowing experienced developers and expected to handle clients within 1–2 weeks. We are now initiating the next phase: establishing the Software Engineering & Product Delivery Department, Cloud, DevOps & Platform Engineering Department, and AI, Data Science & Business Intelligence Department departments. 

Our goal is to develop a robust, multifaceted tech team capable of handling client-based projects while also pursuing internal initiatives that support growth, exposure, and talent retention. 

Objectives 

Build and train skilled teams in Backend, Frontend, DevOps, and AI/Data Science. 

Execute strategic internal projects that showcase our capabilities. 

Increase brand visibility through participation in expos. 

Leverage project outcomes to attract potential investors. 

Provide interns and new hires with growth opportunities aligned with their interests. 

Internal Project Strategy 

Why Internal Projects? 

Non-Time-Bound - These projects are flexible and can be worked on alongside client tasks.  

Career Alignment - Trainees gain hands-on experience in their fields of interest. 

Exposure & Branding - Projects can be showcased during expos, building credibility. 

Investor Readiness - Demonstrated competence will make fundraising pitches more convincing. 

Execution Plan 

Allocate internal projects as a secondary task trainees and staff will work on them during downtime or as parallel assignments. 

Encourage cross-functional collaboration between Power Platform, AI, Software Engineering, and DevOps teams. 

Track progress and identify promising outcomes to present at expos and pitch to potential investors. 

Department-Specific Approach 

1. Software Engineering & Product Delivery 

Begin with client-facing and internal software products across the web, mobile, and enterprise platforms. 

Assign new hires to low-risk internal modules first, gradually transitioning them to client projects. 

Incorporate UI/UX design and feedback loops into development cycles to build intuitive, user-centered products. 

Introduce QA practices from day one test-driven development (TDD), automated testing pipelines, and user acceptance testing. 

Identify small tools or platforms we can showcase at expos. 

2. Cloud, DevOps & Platform Engineering 

Set up and manage CI/CD pipelines for all departments using GitHub Actions or similar. 

Manage Azure and AWS environments for deployment, testing, and demoing products. 

Offer infrastructure and platform support for freelance and internal projects. 

Integrate Microsoft 365 and Power Platform tools into internal workflows. 

Interns will gain hands-on experience by helping maintain staging environments and automating basic ops tasks. 

3. AI, Data Science & Business Intelligence 

Launch parallel (not necessary) internal AI/data science projects using open or synthetic datasets. 

Assign trainees to dual roles: supporting client data needs while contributing to internal R&D. 

Embed business analysis training and tasks within projects to help bridge technical solutions and user needs. 

Create demo visualizations and intelligent systems for expo presentation and investor decks. 

4. Training, R&D & Talent Development 

Continue developing the Power Platform talent pipeline:  

from trainee → shadowing → independent project delivery. 

Design a modular training roadmap for software, cloud, and AI tracks, including soft skills and workplace readiness. 

Launch an internal R&D initiative for each department—small, scoped innovation with potential for productization. 

Encourage cross-department collaboration to spark innovative ideas and allow skill exploration across disciplines.
